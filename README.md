needs Bill Greiman`s SdFat-beta https://github.com/greiman/SdFat-beta to support both Teensy 4.0 and ExFAT filesystems
 
code is based on https://github.com/yoonghm/MTP

files in copy-of-core contain modifications of core and need to be copied to cores/teensy4

copying files from Teensy to PC  and from PC to Teensy is working

To be done:

 - check T3.6 backward compatibility

 - check SdFat compatibility
